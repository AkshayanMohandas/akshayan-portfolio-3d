# Akshayan Portfolio 3D

**Akshayan Mohandas - Interactive 3D Portfolio Website**

An immersive 3D portfolio experience built using [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) and [Ammo.js](https://github.com/kripken/ammo.js), featuring real-time physics, interactive 3D objects, and a space-themed environment.

_This project is based on the original work by [0xfloyd](https://github.com/0xfloyd) and has been significantly customized and enhanced for personal portfolio use._

## Live Demo

## About This Project

This 3D portfolio showcases my work and skills through an interactive space-themed environment. The project combines modern web technologies with 3D graphics to create an engaging user experience.

**Original Inspiration:** This project is based on the excellent work by [0xfloyd](https://github.com/0xfloyd) and inspired by [Google Experiments](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/), [Three.js examples](https://threejs.org/), [Lee Stemkoski](https://home.adelphi.edu/~stemkoski/) and [Three.js Fundamentals](https://threejsfundamentals.org/).

## About the Developer

**Akshayan Mohandas** - Software Developer & 3D Enthusiast

This portfolio showcases my skills in modern web development, 3D graphics, and interactive user experiences. The project demonstrates proficiency in JavaScript, Three.js, physics simulation, and responsive design.

## Features

- Desktop and Mobile Responsiveness with both keyboard and touch screen controls
- Raycasting with event listeners for user touch and click interaction
- FPS tracker to monitor frame rate/ rendering performance
- Asset compression with webpack plugin to help with quick site load times

## Technology

- Three.js (3D Graphics)
- Ammo.js (Physics Engine)
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express (Node.js framework)
- Webpack (module/ dependency bundler)
- HTML/CSS
- Ready for deployment (Heroku, Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
- Git (version control) / Github for code hosting
